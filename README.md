# iTunes Rich Presence for Discord
This is an application that lets you have a personalized Discord status based on what you're listening to on iTunes (or Music, if you're on MacOS >=10.15). The status will show the song name, artist, album name, time elapsed since the track started playing and index of the track in the album. Additionally, an image with a "playing" or "paused" button will be shown in case the track is playing or paused. For some examples, see the [screenshots](#screenshots).

## Features
* Simple to use.
* No in-app login required.
* Lightweight (~1.5MB file).
* Works on both MacOS and Windows.
* Ugly UI.

## Requirements
* **MacOS** / **Windows**.
* A Java Runtime Environment (**JRE**), minimum version **1.8** (you can download it from [here](https://java.com/download/)).
* If the application displays an error window even when everything is set up correctly, installing the Java Development Kit will fix the issue (you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)).
* [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/) and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/download) applications.
* For **Windows** users: this application should work for iTunes version 4.7 or later.

## Usage
* Download the application as:
  * [*jar*](https://github.com/kevinmussi/iTunes-Discord-RP/releases/download/1.3/iTunesDiscordRP-1.3.jar): it can be run on either OS.
  * [*dmg*](https://github.com/kevinmussi/iTunes-Discord-RP/releases/download/1.3/iTunesDiscordRP-1.3.dmg): image that contains the *.app* bundle that can be run on **MacOS** as a native application (double click on the .dmg file, then extract the .app file to wherever you want).
  * [*exe*](https://github.com/kevinmussi/iTunes-Discord-RP/releases/download/1.3/iTunesDiscordRP-1.3.exe): executable that can be run on **Windows** as a native application.
* Double click on it.
* For **Mac** users: the first time you try to launch the app, it can happen that MacOS doesn't let you. If that's the case, you must open the file by right-clicking it, selecting "Open" and then selecting "Open" again on the dialog that appears (this must be done only once).
* Done!

## To-dos
* Javadocs.
* Unit tests.
* Spotify integration (easy but rather useless).
* Command line only interface.
* Allow customization of the rich presence elements.
* Make it a menu bar app for MacOS.
